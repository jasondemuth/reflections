when you initialize a repo - you create a .git file that tracks changes.

staging area is what is about to be committed, 

just opening git diff with no arguements is cool

git add file.txt      - this adds file to staging area
git commit -m "Commit comment"    - to commit a staging area


git diff - compares staging area to working directory
git diff --staged    -- compares staging vs last commit.

git branch - view branches
git branch name       -- creates new branch with that name

git checkout branchname     - to switch to branch
