when you initialize a repo - you create a .git file that tracks changes.

staging area is what is about to be committed, 

just opening git diff with no arguements is cool

git add file.txt      - this adds file to staging area
git commit -m "Commit comment"    - to commit a staging area


git diff - compares staging area to working directory
git diff --staged    -- compares staging vs last commit.

git branch - view branches
git branch name       -- creates new branch with that name

git checkout branchname     - to switch to branch


git log --graph --oneline branch branch       -- this will give a log and show what branches are affected.


git checkout -b new_branch_name     -- makes new branch and checks it out

merging files - check out master branch
***command to merge***	git merge master branch
	   - adds a merge commit and message

git show     - will show git diff between it and a parent

git branch -d branch      -- this will delete branch label
