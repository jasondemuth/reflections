Version control will help me work smarter

by looking at two versions, can determine what changed and make corrections/reversions

by having access to old versions and changes you can see progress, and methods used to move forward

manual commits are good as long as you think about them and are disciplined to do it.

git allowing to save multiple files at a single commit is special and necessary

git log is great - remember to hit enter to scroll down and q to exit
